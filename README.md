# ðŸ“ˆ Historical VaR Portfolio Analyzer

**Professional Historical VaR Analysis Portal for Investment Portfolios**

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application for analyzing the Value at Risk (VaR) of investment portfolios using historical data. It provides two main types of risk analysis:

- **Point-in-Time VaR**: Analyze your portfolioâ€™s risk as of today using recent market data.
- **Time Series VaR**: Track how your portfolioâ€™s risk evolves over time.
