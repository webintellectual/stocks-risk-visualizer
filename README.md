# ðŸ“ˆ Historical VaR Portfolio Analyzer

**Professional Historical VaR Analysis Portal for Investment Portfolios**

---

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application for analyzing the Value at Risk (VaR) of investment portfolios using historical data. It provides two main types of risk analysis:

- **Point-in-Time VaR**: Analyze your portfolioâ€™s risk as of today using recent market data.
- **Time Series VaR**: Track how your portfolioâ€™s risk evolves over time.

- **Point-in-Time VaR**:  
  - Calculates current portfolio risk at a chosen confidence level  
  - Visualizes maximum potential loss  
  - Useful for asset allocation and benchmarking

- **Time Series VaR**:  
  - Shows risk trends and historical patterns  
  - Identifies periods of elevated or reduced risk  
  - Stress-tests against past market scenarios

- **Data Sources**:  
  - Fetches historical prices using Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
  - Supports CSV uploads for custom portfolios

- **Visualizations**:  
  - Modern, interactive charts (Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
